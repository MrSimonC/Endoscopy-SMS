# Endoscopy SMS
## Background
Created for North Bristol Trust Endoscopy department when there was no sms solution available. Evolved to use an email sms gateway called DrDr, this program contacts the Patient Administration System Extract database, extracts patient appointments and mobile numbers, then sends a reminder to each patient.

## Installation and Running
- For personalisation, edit the `endoscopy_sms.py` with database login details
- Run `sms v2.0.exe` and the user will be guided through the process
